GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================

This repository contains the information requested in the course project for the Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data" (see https://class.coursera.org/getdata-016/human_grading)

In here you will find :
* the raw data, in the zip file called "UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip" and unzipped in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder
* the "run_analysis.R" script that performs the operations requested in the assignment :
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* the "tidy.txt" file, which contains the output of the 5th step described above
* this "README.md" file
* the code book describing the values
